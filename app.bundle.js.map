Builder functions \n\t   * should only be dependent on the state definition object and super function.\n\t   *\n\t   *\n\t   * Existing builder functions and current return values:\n\t   *\n\t   * - **parent** `{object}` - returns the parent state object.\n\t   * - **data** `{object}` - returns state data, including any inherited data that is not\n\t   *   overridden by own values (if any).\n\t   * - **url** `{object}` - returns a {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher UrlMatcher}\n\t   *   or `null`.\n\t   * - **navigable** `{object}` - returns closest ancestor state that has a URL (aka is \n\t   *   navigable).\n\t   * - **params** `{object}` - returns an array of state params that are ensured to \n\t   *   be a super-set of parent's params.\n\t   * - **views** `{object}` - returns a views object where each key is an absolute view \n\t   *   name (i.e. \"viewName@stateName\") and each value is the config object \n\t   *   (template, controller) for the view. Even when you don't use the views object \n\t   *   explicitly on a state config, one is still created for you internally.\n\t   *   So by decorating this builder function you have access to decorating template \n\t   *   and controller properties.\n\t   * - **ownParams** `{object}` - returns an array of params that belong to the state, \n\t   *   not including any params defined by ancestor states.\n\t   * - **path** `{string}` - returns the full path from the root down to this state. \n\t   *   Needed for state activation.\n\t   * - **includes** `{object}` - returns an object that includes every state that \n\t   *   would pass a `$state.includes()` test.\n\t   *\n\t   * @example\n\t   * <pre>\n\t   * // Override the internal 'views' builder with a function that takes the state\n\t   * // definition, and a reference to the internal function being overridden:\n\t   * $stateProvider.decorator('views', function (state, parent) {\n\t   *   var result = {},\n\t   *       views = parent(state);\n\t   *\n\t   *   angular.forEach(views, function (config, name) {\n\t   *     var autoName = (state.name + '.' + name).replace('.', '/');\n\t   *     config.templateUrl = config.templateUrl || '/partials/' + autoName + '.html';\n\t   *     result[name] = config;\n\t   *   });\n\t   *   return result;\n\t   * });\n\t   *\n\t   * $stateProvider.state('home', {\n\t   *   views: {\n\t   *     'contact.list': { controller: 'ListController' },\n\t   *     'contact.item': { controller: 'ItemController' }\n\t   *   }\n\t   * });\n\t   *\n\t   * // ...\n\t   *\n\t   * $state.go('home');\n\t   * // Auto-populates list and item views with /partials/home/contact/list.html,\n\t   * // and /partials/home/contact/item.html, respectively.\n\t   * </pre>\n\t   *\n\t   * @param {string} name The name of the builder function to decorate. \n\t   * @param {object} func A function that is responsible for decorating the original \n\t   * builder function.

However, if\n\t   *     only one value is present (e.g.: `/foo?bar=1`) then the value is treated as single\n\t   *     value (e.g.: `{ foo: '1' }`).\n\t   *\n\t   * <pre>params: {\n\t   *     param1: { array: true }\n\t   * }</pre>\n\t   *\n\t   *   - ** squash ** - {bool|string=}: `squash` configures how a default parameter value is represented in the URL when\n\t   *     the current parameter value is the same as the default value. If `squash` is not set, it uses the\n\t   *     configured default squash policy.\n\t   *     (See {@link ui.router.util.$urlMatcherFactory#methods_defaultSquashPolicy `defaultSquashPolicy()`})\n\t   *\n\t   *   There are three squash settings:\n\t   *\n\t   *     - false: The parameter's default value is not squashed.

This custom service let's you\n * scroll ui-view elements into view when they are populated during a state activation.\n *\n * @param {string=} noanimation If truthy, the non-animated renderer will be selected (no animations\n * will be applied to the ui-view)\n *\n * *Note: To revert back to old [`$anchorScroll`](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$anchorScroll)\n * functionality, call `$uiViewScrollProvider.useAnchorScroll()`.*\n *\n * @param {string=} onload Expression to evaluate whenever the view updates.\n * \n * @example\n * A view can be unnamed or named. \n * <pre>\n * <!-- Unnamed -->\n * <div ui-view></div> \n * \n * <!-- Named -->\n * <div ui-view=\"viewName\"></div>\n * </pre>\n *\n * You can only have one unnamed view within any template (or root html). If you are only using a \n * single view and it is unnamed then you can populate it like so:\n * <pre>\n * <div ui-view></div> \n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n * })\n * </pre>\n * \n * The above is a convenient shortcut equivalent to specifying your view explicitly with the {@link ui.router.state.$stateProvider#views `views`}\n * config property, by name, in this case an empty name:\n * <pre>\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     }\n *   }    \n * })\n * </pre>\n * \n * But typically you'll only use the views property if you name your view or have more than one view \n * in the same template. There's not really a compelling reason to name a view if its the only one, \n * but you could if you wanted, like so:\n * <pre>\n * <div ui-view=\"main\"></div>\n * </pre> \n * <pre>\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"main\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     }\n *   }    \n * })\n * </pre>\n * \n * Really though, you'll use views to set up multiple views:\n * <pre>\n * <div ui-view></div>\n * <div ui-view=\"chart\"></div> \n * <div ui-view=\"data\"></div> \n * </pre>\n * \n * <pre>\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     },\n *     \"chart\": {\n *       template: \"<chart_thing/>\"\n *     },\n *     \"data\": {\n *       template: \"<data_thing/>\"\n *     }\n *   }    \n * })\n * </pre>\n *\n * Examples for `autoscroll`:\n *\n * <pre>\n * <!-- If autoscroll present with no expression,\n *      then scroll ui-view into view -->\n * <ui-view autoscroll/>\n *\n * <!-- If autoscroll present with valid expression,\n *      then scroll ui-view into view if expression evaluates to true -->\n * <ui-view autoscroll='true'/>\n * <ui-view autoscroll='false'/>\n * <ui-view autoscroll='scopeVariable'/>\n * </pre>\n */\n$ViewDirective.$inject = ['$state', '$injector', '$uiViewScroll', '$interpolate'];\nfunction $ViewDirective(   $state,   $injector,   $uiViewScroll,   $interpolate) {\n\n  function getService() {\n    return ($injector.has) ? function(service) {\n      return $injector.has(service) ? $injector.get(service) : null;\n    } : function(service) {\n      try {\n        return $injector.get(service);\n      } catch (e) {\n        return null;\n      }\n    };\n  }\n\n  var service = getService(),\n      $animator = service('$animator'),\n      $animate = service('$animate');\n\n  // Returns a set of DOM manipulation functions based on which Angular version\n  // it should use\n  function getRenderer(attrs, scope) {\n    var statics = {\n      enter: function (element, target, cb) { target.after(element);
